# 03 Javascript - Password Generator

## Task

Week three's homework was to use what we've learned so far to create an online app that generates a random pasword using javascript.
## User Story

```
AS AN employee, I want to be able to create a highly secure password
SO THAT I am able to protect confidential and sensitive work data.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new and secure password
I USED javascript to create an online app
SO THAT I can have a rando and secure password generated for me
I USED prompts to establish number of characters
SO THAT when prompted I or the user could choose the desired length of the password
I USED a series of prompts to establish whether or not to include letters, numbers and special characters
SO THAT I or the user could specify how complex and secure the password would be
I USED a "generate password" button
SO THAT after all prompts were answered, the app would randomize the criteria to generate and display a unique series of characters
I USED a "copy password" button 
SO THAT all the characters could be copied with the click of a single button for I or the user to then paste wherever needed
```

## Summary

This assignment was the most challenging one I've experienced so far. I spent more time and effort on it than any of my prior assignments and had to learn much of the proper structure and syntax by viewing other online sources in addition to what we learned in class. I did a lot of comparing and contrasting various methods and styles of similar apps I researched.
